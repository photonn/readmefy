# Mock Project

## Description

This repository consists of a small project with a simple structure, demonstrating basic features of Python and JavaScript. It includes a Python script for adding numbers, a JavaScript file for printing a simple greeting, and a basic HTML file to display information as a webpage.

## Prerequisites

### Python Version
- Python 3.x

### Imports
- No external libraries are required. The project uses only the Python Standard Library.

### Keys
- No API keys or other type of keys are required.

## Usage

### Python
To run the Python script, you will need to have Python installed on your system. Navigate to the project directory and run:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will execute the Python script (`main.py`) which adds two numbers (2 and 3) and prints the result to the console.

### JavaScript
To run the JavaScript, you can either:
- Open `index.html` in a web browser and view the console to see the greeting message,
- Or run the JavaScript file (`script.js`) directly using Node.js by navigating to the directory containing the script and running:
```bash
node script.js
```

### HTML
Open the `index.html` file in any web browser to see the static HTML content displayed as a webpage.

## Limitations
- The Python and JavaScript code are extremely basic and intended for demonstration purposes.
- There might be compatibility issues based on different environments or unsupported versions of Python.
- The HTML file does not link to the JavaScript file, so the script needs to be run separately for demonstration.
- No advanced error handling or input sanitization is implemented.
